##Bubble Up

## Elevator Pitch

*A narrative journey where you explore customers’ daily struggles and solutions, helping you navigate your own imposter syndrome along the way in the setting of a boba shop.*

## Influences (Brief)

- *Coffee Talk*: 
  - Medium: *Video Game*
  - Explanation: *Coffee Talk allows you to work as a barista while chatting with customers, serving fantasy creatures alongside humans that are dealing with different struggles. The game tackles discrimination, forbidden love, career struggles, and more. You can help ease your customers’ minds by crafting an appropriate drink based on a recipe book and what specials you have in stock for the day.
- *Papa’s Freezeria*
  - Medium: *Video Game*
  - Explanation: *Papa’s Freezeria allows players to build different drinks and milkshakes by interacting with customers and taking orders. After taking the orders, players have to go through the stations needed to build the desired drink while keeping an eye on the lobby in case any other customers walk in. Players receive tips from customers based on the time and quality of their work. Bubble Up resembles this format as players will need to make drinks and interact with customers to learn about computer science. Players may even receive tips and payments to use for power-ups later on in the game*
- *Sims*:
  - Medium: *Video Game*
  - Explanation: *In the Sims, there is a stats system where the player has to manage the different types of stats (like hunger, energy, happiness) in order to keep the player’s Sims alive and well. These stats can be affected by the action of the player or by the action of the game, but at the end of the day, it is always the player’s choice on whether or not the player wants to act upon these stat changes. Bubble Up takes the idea of stats and runs with it as part of its core night mechanics in how the player has to manage their stats based on what they hear or their objective, as it is always the player’s choice whether or not to take different actions to fill up different stats.*

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Brief)

*Give a very high-level description of any core gameplay mechanics*

- *Dialogue System: Engage with customers (CS students!) - This dialogue system is how the player will learn about their customers and what their customers do, this is the main storyline takes place and how the player will learn about different things and thus will appear later that night as an option for the player to do/make. For example, if a customer mentions taking a walk helped out their stress, then later that night, the player has the option to take a walk that can affect their stress level*

- *Drink Prep: Make Boba and Teas - As the player talk to their customers, they have to do their job, which means making fun drinks according to the customer’s order! This will not affect the dialogue system, even if the player messes up due to the scope and timing of the project*

- *Manage the Levels when you go Home for the Day- Players will have energy levels that reflect their energy and mental stability/stress. These energy levels will affect what actions the player can perform and how well they are able to do their job, certain stats will affect different actions the player may or may not make during the day*

- *Manage upcoming assignments and exams- Players have a calendar where they can see all upcoming tasks for the week. Each task will have its own completion progress bar. The player must balance their actions each night to successfully finish all tasks in a week.*

- *Day/Night Cycle- Players will work in a cozy boba shop during the day and perform small activities at night based on what they hear from the dialogue systems and their upcoming tasks, which would affect the energy levels they perform at night*

# Learning Aspects

## Learning Domains

*Metacognitive (self-regulation, reflection), Affective (task management)*

## Target Audiences

*This game is open to all high school and college students but is mainly targeted at college students majoring in a computer science-related field*

## Target Contexts

*Bubble Up can be formally used as a module in introductory computer science courses as a way for students to explore imposter syndrome and ways to manage it. Informally, any computer science student who struggles with or wants to learn more about imposter syndrome can play Bubble Up on their laptop in any setting.* 

## Learning Objectives

*Remember, Learning Objectives are NOT simply topics. They are statements of observable behavior that a learner can do after the learning experience. You cannot observe someone "understanding" or "knowing" something.*

- *Identifying Imposter Syndrome*: *By the end of instruction, students should be able to identify emotions and thoughts associated with Imposter Syndrome.*
- *Applying Coping Mechanisms*: *By the end of instruction, students should be able to respond with techniques and coping mechanisms related to self-compassion and a growth mindset to combat Imposter Syndrome.*
- *Managing Responsibilities*: *By the end of instruction, students should be able to organize their school workload in a way that does not impede work-life balance and mental health.*

## Prerequisite Knowledge

- *Basic Emotional Awareness*
- *Basic Time Management Skills*

## Assessment Measures

*Students will be provided with an entrance and exit survey that has situational multiple-choice and open-response questions surrounding how they would handle common situations that involve imposter syndrome and workload management.*

# What sets this project apart?

*Give some reasons why this game is not like every other game out there. Whether the learning objective is unique, the gameplay mechanics are new, or what. You should persuade the reader that your game is novel and worthy of development. Consider arguments that would be persuasive to a Venture Capitalist, Teacher, or Researcher. These might be focused on learning needs, too.*

- *Bubble Up will introduce a range of relatable experiences and stressors of computer science students based directly on real-life experiences of current undergraduates (such as internship searching, having too many responsibilities, feeling like you don’t have enough responsibilities, struggling to connect with others, etc.)*
- *While many students are told Imposter Syndrome is common, they might not know how and why other peers similar to them struggle with it. By introducing characters in situations similar to what real students experience, players can resonate with it more and recognize Imposter Syndrome in themselves more easily.*
- *Bubble Up combines the fun nostalgic feel of Papa’s Freezeria and cooking games with computer science and mental health skills. It is engaging, and educational and allows players to get creative with their avatars, drink designs, and flavors while teaching them about imposter syndrome.*

# Player Interaction Patterns and Modes



## Player Interaction Pattern

*This is a game for one person. The player clicks/drags with a mouse.*

## Player Modes

*Your game has one or more player modes. Describe each discrete mode, considering things like menus too. Generally describe the transitions between modes too.*

- *Single Player Mode: * You will make drinks, talk to customers, and manage your stats advancing through each day until the narrative is done (ending based on the stats, ~1 week in-game time)*

# Gameplay Objectives

- *Run boba shop*:
    - Description: *Make delicious drinks for customers and listen to them speak about their day*
    - Alignment: *The customers are CS students who talk about their experiences and feelings with their major. Listening and responding to the customers will teach users about the struggles and CS students and how to manage them. *
- *Complete all tasks for the week while maintaining stress and energy levels*:
    - Description: *Players are given a list of tasks that need to be completed outside of work for the week. Taking actions to complete them will impact stress and energy levels.*
    - Alignment: *Students learn time management skills while considering how it impacts their mental health, both physically and mentally.*

# Procedures/Actions

*You can click on the customer in the line, and spark up a conversation while simultaneously taking their order. Once the conversation ends, you’ll receive a ticket for your order. Then, they began making their bubble tea drink based on what the receipt stated.*

*Describe the control scheme and what actions a user can take in the game.*

*The user can control the making of the drinks, however, the conversations between the customers are preset. So the user can not alter the dialogue. The user also can customize their character to make it more personable.*

# Rules
*If the player makes a drink wrong, they have to remake the drink, and stress increases*
*If your energy and stress levels are maxed out, you have to replay the prior day*
*After a customer leaves, a new customer with a new drink order comes in*
*Over time, you will unlock new actions based on your daytime work time that the player can make during the nighttime free time*

# Objects/Entities

*Shop Interactable: juices, boba, blender, toppings, tickets*
*Bedroom Interactable: bed, laptop, cat, record player, journaling materials*
*Game Menu Interactable: phone, help, calendar*

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Detailed)

- *Interacting with Order Tickets*: You can click and drag the tickets only to the left or the right of your screen. When clicking the ticket, the ticket will expand on the screen showcasing all the ingredients the customer wants in the bubble tea. *Describe in 2 paragraphs or less, along with how it generally works*

- *Interacting with the customers*: *You can click on the customers to “talk” to them, and you can learn more about them and their lives. When you click on them, a speech bubble appears on the bottom of the screen with the icon of the person you are clicking. Once all the text appears, you can click next, to continue the conversation until it ends.*

- *Managing on levels*: *You manage your energy and stress levels. These can be impacted by the success of fulfilling orders in the shop, making progress on upcoming assignments, and getting enough rest each night.*
    
## Feedback

*When giving the customer their drink, they smile if the order is correct and frown if it is incorrect.*
*The facial expressions can vary between customers during the conversations, some may have a mad expression, while others can have a happy or sad expression*

*Explicitly describe what visual/audio/animation indicators there are that give players feedback on their progress towards their gameplay objectives (and ideally the learning objectives).*

*Selection sound, to indicate that the user has clicked something*
*Phone Buzz Sound to indicate when there is something on the phone the player should see: new item unlocked, mental note made, etc.*
*Bell sound at the start of shop day*
*Energy & Stress Levels will change based off the player’s interaction*
*Happy twinkle sound at the end of a good day (stress levels low), whomp sound at the end of a bad day (stress levels high)*


*Describe what longer-term feedback you detect and give that guides the player in their learning and lets them know how they are doing in regard to the learning objectives.*

*If the character ended the day poorly, a ‘DUN DUN’ (negative feedback sound) would play*
*If the character ended the day on a good note, a ‘Sparkle’ (positive feedback sound) would play*

# Story and Gameplay

## Presentation of Rules

*Players will have a “training day* at the beginning of their “week” where they will be prompted to complete actions that teach them the rules of the game: how to make drinks, how to manage their levels, and how to continue the game through dialogue. There will also be a “help” button in the game menu that will offer hints and guidance to players whenever needed*

## Presentation of Content

*Briefly describe how the player will be taught the core material they are meant to learn. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching material iteratively and slowly.*

*The player will learn about imposter syndrome through the dialogue of the characters (each representing different forms of imposters) and through the management of their stress and energy levels during the gameplay. The game will either show or not show interactable items to the player depending on their levels, representing how when one is suffering from imposter syndrome, it can almost “blind” them to the reality of things. *

## Story (Brief)

*The Summary or TL;DR version of below*
*The player works at a Boba Shop where they make drinks and interact with four characters, each with different personality types (busy bee, shy/athletic, relaxed/down to Earth, and the professor) and each suffers from different manifestations of imposter syndrome. Each day in the shop, you learn more about what each character does, how they suffer from Imposter Syndrome, and how to overcome your own stress and imposter syndrome. *

## Storyboarding

*Go into as much detail as needed to visually convey the Dynamics of your game. Be detailed. Create storyboards and freeze frame images that concisely capture important key elements of your game. You are strongly recommended to sketch pictures on paper and embed them here. Be sure to make it clear how previously described mechanics come through in the dynamics.*
